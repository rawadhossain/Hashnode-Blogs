In this blog, we will get to know about AWS Integration & Messaging, more about SNS, SQS and Kinesis

## Intro

AWS Integration & Messaging refers to services designed to facilitate communication between applications, systems, and components in a distributed architecture. These services enable **asynchronous communication**, **event-driven workflows**, and **data streaming**, ensuring scalable, reliable, and decoupled interactions.

### **Problem They Solve**

1. **Scalability Issues:**
    
    * **Problem:** Monolithic architectures struggle to handle increasing workloads.
        
    * **Solution:** Messaging services decouple components, allowing independent scaling.
        
2. **Tight Coupling:**
    
    * **Problem:** Systems dependent on direct communication become fragile and hard to maintain.
        
    * **Solution:** These services enable asynchronous and loosely coupled communication.
        
3. **Data Processing Delays:**
    
    * **Problem:** Processing large volumes of real-time data can lead to latency.
        
    * **Solution:** Kinesis handles high-throughput, low-latency data streaming.
        
4. **Reliability and Fault Tolerance:**
    
    * **Problem:** Communication failures disrupt workflows.
        
    * **Solution:** SQS guarantees message delivery; SNS ensures notifications reach all subscribers
